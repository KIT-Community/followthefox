								<h3>Innovations that help the community</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Technology Fighting the Wildfires (Tech FTW) was an innovation
              competition hosted by the KIT Community and the All for One Movement on
              August 5-7, 2016 to develop the best technology tool to help with
              wildfire response and disaster relief in Kern County that would
              respond to specific needs of the affected communities and those
              trying to help them.</p>

              <p>The Erskine and Deer fires recently have greatly affected our
              communities and caused many residents to suddenly find themselves
              without a home and in need of help. This competition was open to
              all professions and experience levels; the only requirement was
              compassion. Teams were formed at the event Friday night and
              worked out innovations throughout the weekend. MESH Cowork was
              available for teams to work.</p>

              <p>Teams were judged on how well the technology tool fit a
              community need and how well the prototype for the technology tool
              was built.</p>

              <p>THEMES: wildfire response, victim assistance, disaster relief</p>

              <p>PRIZE: The winning team, Beacon, won a trophy and cash prize.</p>

              <p>This event was sponsored by these local businesses and
              organizations: KIT Community, the All for One Movement, Mershon
              Enterprises, ARRC Technology, MESH Cowork, KERN 1180, KGFM 101.5,
               iSafety Pro, Community Action Partnership Kern, Union Station Deli, Bakersfield Blaze,
