								<h3>A library tech hackathon</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This event was an innovation competition brought to you by the
              KIT Community and CSU Bakersfield to develop the best technology
              tool to help with library efficiency and patron access in Kern
              County that responds to specific needs of local libraries and the
              community.</p>
              <p>Libraries are a place of accessible knowledge, opportunity, and
              history; a valued community resource. They can also be a place of
              invention and technology. The KIT Community and CSU Bakersfield
              invite you to compete to develop needed technologies to help the
              local libraries better serve the community.</p>
              <p>This competition was open to all professions and experience
              levels. Teams were formed at the event Friday night and worked
              out innovations throughout the weekend. Students in the fields of
              computer science, engineering, business, education, and humanities
              were strongly encouraged to compete.</p>
